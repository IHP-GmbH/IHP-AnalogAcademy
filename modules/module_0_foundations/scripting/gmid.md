### Lookup Table Generation

To generate the lookup tables (LUTs) used in this chapter, we utilized resources from the GitHub repository by [medwatt](https://github.com/medwatt). Specifically, the LUT generation was based on his excellent [`gmid`](https://github.com/medwatt/gmid) project, which provides detailed documentation and well-structured scripts for generating lookup tables. Many thanks to medwatt for making this resource available â€” if you're working on similar tasks, I highly recommend taking a look at the repository!

The scripts that was made for generating the LUTs can be found as:

- `sg13_nmos_lv.py`
- `sg13_pmos_lv.py`

For a practical use case and a more detailed explanation of how these LUTs are applied, please refer to the slides (Introduction_and_welcome_1).
