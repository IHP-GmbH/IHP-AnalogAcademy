### Lookup Table Generation

To generate the lookup tables (LUTs) used in this chapter, we utilized resources from the GitHub repository by [medwatt](https://github.com/medwatt). Specifically, the LUT generation was based on his [`gmid`](https://github.com/medwatt/gmid) project, which includes detailed documentation and supporting scripts.

The primary scripts used for the SG13 low-voltage process are:

- `sg13_nmos_lv.py`
- `sg13_pmos_lv.py`

These scripts can be adapted to generate LUTs for various configurations. For a practical use case and a more detailed explanation of how these LUTs are applied, please refer to the slides (Introduction_and_welcome_1)
