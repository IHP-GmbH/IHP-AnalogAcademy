# ⚠️ Disclaimer – Slides Folder

The content in this folder contains **slides from the in-person Analog Academy course** held at IHP.

> These slides are provided **for reference only** and are intended to **complement** the hands-on tutorials found in the `modules/` directory.

## 📌 Important Notes

- The slides **do not include** all explanations or discussions presented during the live sessions.
- They may contain **incomplete context**, since many concepts were explained orally during the course.
- Users are **strongly advised** to follow the markdown-based tutorials in the `modules/` folder for a full understanding of the material.

### ✅ Best Practice

Use these slides as:
- A visual aid
- A supplement to the markdown tutorials
- A high-level overview of topics covered

Do **not** rely on them as a standalone learning resource.
